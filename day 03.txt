3.Read about the difference between windows,screen and document in javascript?

window:Each browser tab has its own top-level window object. Each <iframe> (and deprecated <frame>)
element has its own window object too, nested within a parent window. Each of these windows gets
its own separate global object.

document:Each window object has a document object to be rendered. These objects get confused in part
because HTML elements are added to the global object when assigned a unique id. E.g., in the
HTML snippet

screen :The window object also has a screen object with properties describing the physical display:
*screen properties width and height are the full screen
*screen properties availWidth and availHeight omit the toolbar
